Make a program for specifying the ground truth for buoy location (centre and radius)
    - Display frame and frame number - Done
    - go forwards and backwards - Done
    - Draw a circle and centre point to show the position and radius of the buoy
        - Create a drawing area to display the image
        - Create and update a pixel buffer for the current frame image
        - On configure and resize events we draw the pixel buffer to the drawable area
        - We also draw the circle and dot into the drawable area
        
    - Click to set buoy centre
    - Use text box to set radius
    - Save and load ground truth to and from YAML file - Done
    - Lerp between key-frames - Done
    - Redo the GUI for the program using Glade
    
Write a script to evaluate the performance of a tracker algorithm against the ground truth
    - Give error per frame
        - Square of position error. If the tracker gets visible/invisible wrong then give a fixed penalty of half the screen diagonal squared
    - Total and average error over a number of frames
    - Allow the error to be tracked over just a subset of the frames
